# BitcoinPM
BitcoinPM is a PERL module for connecting to bitcoind instances as a client, though 
incomplete example.pl will work.

Currently only a few functions are implemented and tested against Bitcoin Core v0.11.1

Dependencies:
   - Moo
   - JSON
   - JSON::RPC::Client

TODO:
   - Implement the rest of the standard bitcoind functions
   - Documentation
